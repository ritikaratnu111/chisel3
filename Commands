As all theses files are present in the main directory, run these from there

Commands:

cd verilator
cd chisel-tutorial
sbt
test:runMain problems.Launcher (NAME) --is-verbose
to generate verilog file : test:runMain problems.Launcher (NAME) --backend-name verilator


Make sure the name of the class and that in launcher has to be the same irrespective of the file name.
